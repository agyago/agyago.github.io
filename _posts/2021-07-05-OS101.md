Virtual File System
<ol>
<li> /dev = device nodes, which gives user space access to the device drivers in your OS's running kernel.<br><br>
two types of device files: **block device** and **character device**.
* block devices 
  +  = storage devices (large or fixed size). e.g disks, RAM, cdroms.<br>
  + = userland and block device is mediated by a subsystem. these subsystem prepare/buffer necessary reources. e.g keeping read data in cache first.<br>
* character device 
  + = slow devices which operates as read/write (doesn't require frequent seek queries) e.g Keyboard, serial ports.
  + = system calls go directly to device drivers. <br><br>
**not all devices in /dev are hardware devices**<br>
e.g /dev/null or /dev/zero = write or reading never returns any data.

```bash
$ ls -l /dev
crw-r--r-- 1 root root     10, 235 Jun 16 10:30 autofs  # c means char device ; 10 is major and 235 is minor
brw-rw---- 1 root disk      1,   0 Jun 16 10:30 ram0    # b means block device ; 1 is major and 0 is minor
....
```
<li> /proc = information about system and hardware. also it is being used as a medium between userland and kernel
```bash
/proc/PID/cmdline       # Command line arguments
/proc/PID/cwd           # Link to the current working directory
/proc/PID/fd            # Directory of file descriptors
/proc/PID/maps          # Memory maps to executables and library files
/proc/PID/mem           # Memory held by this process
/proc/PID/stat          # Process status
/proc/PID/statm	        # Process memory status information
/proc/PID/status        # Process status in human readable form
/proc/PID/wchan         # it shows the task is blocked in - or “0” if not blocked
```
</ol>
