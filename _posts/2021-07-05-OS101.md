## Intro to OS
*my dump of files from into to OS*

Linux
Layers:
Ring 0 = Kernel                     Most Priviledged
                                          |
Ring 1 = Device Driver                    |
                                          |
Ring 2 = Device Driver                    |
                                          v
Ring 3 = user/application          Least Priviledged


Virtual File System
1. /dev = device nodes, which gives user space access to the device drivers in your OS's running kernel.
  2 types of device files: **block device** and **character device**.
  block devices    = storage devices (large or fixed size). e.g disks, RAM, cdroms.
                   = userland and block device is mediated by a subsystem. these subsystem prepare/buffer necessary reources. e.g keeping read data in cache first.
  character device = slow devices which operates as read/write (doesn't require frequent seek queries) e.g Keyboard, serial ports.
                   = system calls go directly to device drivers.
```bash
$ ls -l /dev
crw-r--r-- 1 root root     10, 235 Jun 16 10:30 autofs    # c means char device ; 10 is major and 235 is minor
brw-rw---- 1 root disk      1,   0 Jun 16 10:30 ram0       # b means block device ; 1 is major and 0 is minor
....
```
  **not all devices in /dev are hardware devices**.
  e.g /dev/null or /dev/zero = write or reading never returns any data.
  
2. /proc = information about system and hardware. also it is being used as a medium between userland and kernel
```
/proc/PID/cmdline       # Command line arguments
/proc/PID/cwd           # Link to the current working directory
/proc/PID/fd            # Directory of file descriptors
/proc/PID/maps          # Memory maps to executables and library files
/proc/PID/mem           # Memory held by this process
/proc/PID/stat          # Process status
/proc/PID/statm	        # Process memory status information
/proc/PID/status        # Process status in human readable form
/proc/PID/wchan         # Present with CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y: it shows the kernel function symbol the task is blocked in - or “0” if not blocked
```
