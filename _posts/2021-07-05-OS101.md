<h2>Virtual File System</h2>

* /dev = device nodes, which gives user space access to the device drivers in your OS's running kernel.<br><br>
two types of device files: **block device** and **character device**.
  * block devices 
    +  = storage devices (large or fixed size). e.g disks, RAM, cdroms.<br>
    + = userland and block device is mediated by a subsystem. these subsystem prepare/buffer necessary reources. e.g keeping read data in cache first.<br>
  * character device 
    + = slow devices which operates as read/write (doesn't require frequent seek queries) e.g Keyboard, serial ports.
    + = system calls go directly to device drivers. <br><br>
**not all devices in /dev are hardware devices**<br>
e.g /dev/null or /dev/zero = write or reading never returns any data.

```bash
$ ls -l /dev
crw-r--r-- 1 root root     10, 235 Jun 16 10:30 autofs  # c means char device ; 10 is major and 235 is minor
brw-rw---- 1 root disk      1,   0 Jun 16 10:30 ram0    # b means block device ; 1 is major and 0 is minor
....
```
* /proc = information about system and hardware. also it is being used as a medium between userland and kernel
  
```bash
/proc/PID/cmdline       # Command line arguments
/proc/PID/cwd           # Link to the current working directory
/proc/PID/fd            # Directory of file descriptors
/proc/PID/maps          # Memory maps to executables and library files
/proc/PID/mem           # Memory held by this process
/proc/PID/stat          # Process status
/proc/PID/statm	        # Process memory status information
/proc/PID/status        # Process status in human readable form
/proc/PID/wchan         # it shows the task is blocked in - or “0” if not blocked

/proc/meminfo
anon = claimed by applications
file = claimed by buffers and cache
sysctl vm.overcommit_memory
active anon - used by process
inactive anon - allocated as rss by porcess but nont being used; good candidate for swap 
```
Sysfs is a RAM based file system. (it only exists in RAM, not on harddisk) <br>
= This is how programs talk to the Linux kernel and modules/drivers (take inputs from the user space to control run-time (non permanent) settings). <br>
sysctl command reads the information from the /proc/sys

<h2>Process</h2>
Process is a piece of code that are loaded into memory and will be resourced by CPU. Each process has a unique identifier called 'PID'. <br>
 Three kinds of process in systems:<br>
 + Daemons - process in the background, like services <br>
 + Console - console applications which will be bound to a terminal with active monitoring of its stdout/stderr<br>
 Graphic - display and a window manager<br>

each process has 2 stacks = user and kernel<br>
user = for variables for instruction for user data<br>
kernel = auto variable or functions<br>
top half - critical work interrupts, such as saving register, unmasking..<br>
bottom half - workqueue<br>

OS knows which systemcall to use via systemcall number<br>
process state: new ready blocked running ~> zombie <br>
timeslice cpu. = 100ms<br>
disadvantage of cpu context switch - tlb needs to be reloaded, processor pipeline flush.<br>

<img src="image/childprocess.png">

process 12622 forked process 1264 then process 1264 forked 12579 <br>
1. initial task wait in run queue for service
2. upon starting the script it will read() to inspect a file it will undergo context switching (active to sleep) until i/o is complete
3. upon receiving the data, it reenters the run queue and wait its turn to reissue fork to the start the app
4. the app will instruct to issue read to fetch the info from RAM
5. upon completion of read, a write is issued to display to standard out
6. the process will reawake and will issue complete status

Both processes share files that the parent had open at the time of the fork <br>
and the file table reference count for those files is one greater than it had been. <br>
Similarly, the Child process has the same current directory and changed root (if applicable) as the parent, 
and the inode reference count of those directories is one greater than it had been.
The processes have identical copies of the text, data, and (user) stack regions.
the system implementation determine whether the processes can share a physical copy of the text region.

Difference between parent and child process : 

* Neither process can access the variables of the other process.
* PID of parent and child process are different.
* Process locks, text locks, and data locks are not inherited by the child process.
* The child process utime, stime, cutime, and cstime subroutines are set to 0.
* Any pending alarms are cleared in the child process.
* The set of signals pending for the child process is initialized to an empty set

COW , parent process and child process share the same address space, until one of the process write , if some process write, then 
we create for copying of address space. upon fork the shared space is on read only, and when one of them as to write it will 
create a page fault which will then copy the address space; <br>
or in other words: when data in any of the shared pages change, OS release pag fault and makes a copy of the page

process includes stack, heap,data and code/text <br>
  stack incudes static memory <br>
 heap dynamic memory <br>
data static or global variable <br>
stackoverflow when stack and heap touches (stack goes down and heap goes up) <br>

thread - not isoldated with each other, no need to call system call, shared instructions, global and heap regions, 
each thread has its own stack for local variables, has no own heap and data it is sharing with process, <br>
 -- efficient communications between entities, efficient in context switching coz we dont need to switch page tables

process - isolated
thread pool - assign job to thread and service event - no overhead
process - separate stack, text, data and heap
threads has their own stack but share txt, data, heap with the process

fork:
find unusedPID
set state to newset pointers to newlyformed pagetable, kernel stack, file descriptor
has their own page tables but they are mapped same in the memory

zombies = when a process terminate it becomes a zombie, the parent process reads the child exit status from the PCB, then the process will be reaped <br>
orphan = parent process terminates before child
intentional orphans called daemons run in the background
intentional orphans means the parents exit early before the child

state of prcess:
new
running
waiting
ready
terminated

<h2> Memory </h2>

kernel virtual memory
virtual address space is split: upper part for kernel; lower part is user space
e.g. virtual for 4g; 1gb for kernel ; 3gb for user space

kernel virtual address are adddress in the region above the kernel logical address mappong. also called vmalloc()

swapping
when mem utilization is high the kernel may swap some frames to disk to free RAM 
the kernel can copy a frame to disk and remove its tlb entry, the frame can now be used by other process
when the frame is needed the cpu will generate page fault
the kernel can then at page fault time
put the proicess to sleep
copy the frame from the disk to unused frame in ram
fix the page table entry wake the proicess

page fault is a cpu exception generated when software attempts to use invalid virtual address <br>
3 cases:
* the virtual address is not mapped for the process requesting it 
* the process has sufficient permission for the address
* the virtual address is valid but swapped out

```
virtual memory paging= 4KB
kswapd = ensure that memory stays free;
             = monitors pages_high and pages_low ; if it hits low, it will scan and attempt to free 32 pages at a time
            if the page is unmodified it places the page to the free list
            if the page is modified and backed by a filesystem, it writes the contents of the page to the disk
            if the page is modified and is not backed by any filesystem, it writes the contents of the page to the swap
pdflush = daemon is responsible for sync any pages associated with a file on a filesystem to disk;
             = starts sync the dirty pages back to filesystem when 10% of the pages in memory are dirty.
      systcl  vm.dirty_background_ratio
```
when an application starts, the kernel searches the cpu cache and then physical mem,
if not exist it will issue major page fault - request to disk to retrieve pages off disk and buffer them to ram
once memory pages are in buffer cache, kernel will attempt to issue minor page fault -- reusing page in memory rather than placing 
back to disk
time -v app to see 

buffer cache = as system IO grows over time this buffer cache will continue to grow and leave pages in memory until memory gets low and kernel needs to free some of the pages
```
# cat /proc/meminfo
MemTotal: 2075672 kB
MemFree: 52528 kB
Buffers: 24596 kB
Cached: 1766844 kB
```
The system has a total of 2 GB (MemTotal) of RAM available on it. There is
currently 52 MB of RAM "free" (MemFree), 24 MB RAM that is allocated to disk
write operations (Buffers), and 1.7 GB of pages read from disk in RAM
(Cached). 

Types of memory page
Read Pages = pages of data read via disk(MPF) and are backed on disk. <br>
          = exist in buffer cache and include static files that dont change; these will be paged into memory as it needs them <br>
Dirty pages = pages modified by kernel while in memory. these pages need to be sync back at some point using pdflush. <br>
           in the even of memory shortage kswap along with flushd will write these pages back to disk <br>

sequential i/0 - require large amount of data to read sequentially. example database <br>
iostat -x = display extended stats <br>
random io = amoutn of iops a disk can push like web or mail servers <br>

mmap( ) == allows part of a file or the information stored on a block device to be mapped into a part of a process address
space 

<h2> IPC </h2>
shared memory == .text will be static while .data will changed eventually coz of variables; and will be copy on write(COW)

IPC = files, pipe = 2 fd ; cons = lots of system calls, shared memory (efficient), sending msg; sockets (like printer) 
 === mutex, sephamores - process sync 

mutex - acquire lock and release lock ; 1 at a time <br>
semaphore = (P) wait and (V) signal <br>
                   = P decrease 1 ; if 0 process is blocked until it is non-zero <br>
                   = V increment by 1 <br>
race condition = two process is sharing 1 file/address space that they wanted to read and write <br>
mutex = locks the file to one process until it releases <br>
sephamore = has control of wait and signal ; either process can use wait or signal <br>
fopen = uses buffer ; open = dont use buufer and stream right away <br>
gdp = use for debug c <br>
ulimits -c = check core dump; also to check core dump is to = gdp <program> core <br>
sockets = AF_inet() , SOCK_STREAM = connection send stream or DATAGRAM = single packet chunk; tcp is equal to 0 <br>
parallelism = process A and B run together simultatenously; (multi core can do this) <br>
concurrency = run with each other; example = process A, process B, process A, process B <br>

namedpipes = mkfifo (with p on ls) ; faster than socket and wont be written in disk <br>
virtual alloc for windows || mmap for linux <br>
mmap = map files into memory ; ask OS for memory  <br>
malloc = give memory when requested ; and manages memory via a pointer <br>
brk() == moves the program break <br>
VSZ (virtual mem) == memory that a process can techinically access, a memory allocated but not used;  <br>
                 === can be bigger than you currenlty have (malloc) <br>
RSS (resident) == memory allocated to that process and is in ram <br>
ipcs | statm <br>
IPC shared memory: <br>
shmget = create shared mem <br>
shmat = attache shmid shared mem to address pace of the calling process <br>
shmdt = detach shared mem <br>

deadlock = using xchg instruction via hardware (spinlock), busy waiting (while loop) , <br>
spinlock is useful in short critical sections. <br>
mutex = same with spinlock but with sleep call <br>
thundering herd solution is to use queueing <br>
large job use parallel to finish quickly <br>

Synchronous means to start one after the other's result, in a sequence.

Asynchronous means start together, no sequence is guaranteed on the result

Blocking means something that causes an obstruction to perform the next step.

Non-blocking means something that keeps running without waiting for anything, overcoming the obstruction.
