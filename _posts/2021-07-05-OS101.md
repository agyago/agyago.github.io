# Operating Systems 101: Linux Internals and Process Management

This post is a beginner-friendly but detailed walkthrough of Linux internals, focusing on process management, memory, permissions, and system calls. 
---

## User Space vs. Kernel Space

Linux operates in two main execution contexts:

- **User Space**: Where user applications run. Processes here are restricted—they can't directly interact with hardware or other processes' memory.
- **Kernel Space**: The privileged space where the Linux kernel runs. It controls hardware, manages resources, enforces security, and handles communication between processes and devices.

To interact with hardware (like opening files or creating sockets), user-space programs must go through the **kernel**.

---

## System Calls: The Interface Between Worlds

System calls (syscalls) are the gateway between user space and kernel space.

**Example:**
- When you run `ls`, it eventually uses syscalls like `openat()`, `getdents64()`, and `write()` to list and print directory contents.
- These syscalls are typically wrapped in C library functions (`glibc`), like `opendir()` or `read()`.

**Analogy**: User space is the restaurant guest; kernel space is the kitchen. Syscalls are how you place an order—you can't go cook it yourself.

---

## Privilege Rings (CPU Security Levels)

Linux uses hardware-supported privilege levels (rings):

```
Ring | Usage               | Privilege
-----|---------------------|---------------
0    | Kernel code         | Most privileged
1–2  | Device drivers (rare) | Intermediate
3    | User applications   | Least privileged
```

Only Ring 0 can execute privileged CPU instructions. All syscalls switch from Ring 3 to Ring 0 temporarily.

## Process Management: The Lifecycle

### What is a Process?

A process is an instance of a program running in memory. It has:
- A unique Process ID (PID)
- Two stacks: user and kernel
- Four memory segments: **text** (code), **data**, **heap**, and **stack**

### Process Creation: `fork()` and `execve()`

When you run `ls`, here's what happens:
1. The shell calls `fork()` to create a child process.
2. The child calls `execve("/bin/ls", ["ls"], envp)` to replace its memory with the `ls` binary.
3. The parent waits with `wait()` until the child exits.

**Copy-on-Write (CoW)**: `fork()` doesn't duplicate memory immediately—only when parent/child write to it.

### Process Termination

- `exit()` cleans up a process and marks it as **zombie** until the parent collects its status via `wait()`.
- If the parent doesn't call `wait()`, the zombie remains until adopted by `systemd` (PID 1).

### Signals and `kill()`

Sending a signal (e.g., via `kill` command) results in the kernel delivering that signal to the target process, if permitted.

---

## Process States

States you might see in `ps` or `top`:

```
Code | Description                       | Kernel Term               
-----|-----------------------------------|---------------------------
R    | Running or runnable               | TASK_RUNNING            
S    | Sleeping (interruptible)          | TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE      
D    | Uninterruptible sleep (I/O wait)  | TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE    
Z    | Zombie (terminated, not reaped)   | EXIT_ZOMBIE             
T    | Stopped or traced (e.g., SIGSTOP) | TASK_STOPPED / TASK_TRACED
```

---

## Process Memory Layout

Linux process memory is organized as:

- **Text segment**: Read-only, contains executable code
- **Data segment**: Global/static variables
- **Heap**: Dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`)
- **Stack**: Function call frames, local variables

**Stack grows downward**, **heap grows upward**. Collision = stack overflow.

---

## Threads vs Processes

```
Feature     | Threads                       | Processes                 
------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------
Memory      | Shared                        | Isolated                  
Overhead    | Low (lightweight)             | Higher                    
Security    | Lower (shared memory)         | Higher                    
Switching   | Fast                          | Slower (context switching) 
```

Threads are great for performance, processes are better for isolation.

## Memory Management

### Types of Memory

- **Anonymous**: Allocated by programs (`malloc`)
- **File-backed**: Used for caching disk files
- **Active/Inactive**: Reflect whether memory is currently being accessed

Check with:
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo
```

---

## Virtual Memory and Paging

Linux provides each process its own virtual memory space, mapped to physical memory via **page tables**.

* **Page Faults**: Triggered when a program accesses a page not currently in RAM.
   * Valid but swapped out → kernel loads from disk.
   * Invalid → segmentation fault (`SIGSEGV`).
   * Unauthorized → protection fault.

---

## Swapping

When memory is low:
* `kswapd` frees memory
* `pdflush` writes dirty pages
* Pages are moved to swap space and restored later

---

## File and Device Access

### Devices as Files

Linux treats devices as files under `/dev`.

```bash
$ ls -l /dev
crw-rw---- 1 root tty 4, 1 /dev/tty1 # Character device
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 /dev/sda # Block device
```

* `c`: Character device (e.g., keyboard)
* `b`: Block device (e.g., disks)
* Major/Minor numbers identify device driver and instance

---

## Permissions and SUID/SGID

When a syscall like `open()` is made, the kernel checks:
* **EUID/EGID** of the process
* **UID/GID and permission bits** of the file
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** if present

**SUID/SGID Execution:**
* If the file has SUID/SGID bits:
   * Kernel sets process's EUID/EGID to match file's owner/group before execution
   * Enables temporary privilege escalation

---

## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Methods:
1. **Files**: Simple but inefficient
2. **Pipes**: Stream data between processes (`ps aux | grep ssh`)
3. **Shared Memory**: Fastest, requires synchronization
4. **Message Queues**: Structured message passing
5. **Sockets**: Network communication or local IPC

---

## Synchronization: Mutexes and Semaphores

* **Mutex**: Ensures only one thread/process accesses a resource at a time
* **Semaphore**: Allows controlled access by multiple entities using a counter

---

## I/O Types and Monitoring

* **Sequential I/O**: Efficient for large reads (e.g., logs, backups)
* **Random I/O**: Frequent small reads/writes (e.g., databases)

Monitor with:

```bash
iostat -x
```

---

## Tools: `strace` for Syscall Tracing

`strace` shows you what syscalls a process makes:

```bash
strace ls
strace -e open,read,write cat /etc/hosts
strace -p <PID>
```

Useful for debugging file access, permission issues, and syscall failures (`EACCES`, `ENOENT`, etc.).

---

## Hands-On Challenges

1. Use `strace -o trace.txt ls -l /etc` and identify:
   * `execve`, `openat`, `getdents64`, `write`

2. Try to create a permission-denied error:
```bash
strace touch /root/test
```
Look for `EACCES`.

3. Trace a pipeline:
```bash
strace -f bash -c "ps aux | grep systemd"
```
Identify use of `pipe()`, `fork()`, `execve()`, `dup2()`.
